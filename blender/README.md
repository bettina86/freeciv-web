Blender 3d models created for Freeciv-web.

3d artists are welcome to improve these models!

These are the source Blender model files.

These should be exported in Collada format to:
freeciv-web/src/main/webapp/3d-models/

Filename must match unit name from Freeciv ruleset.

Be sure to limit the file size and number of verticies, since the result
will be rendered in a web browser.
